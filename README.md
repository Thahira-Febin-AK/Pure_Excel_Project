# 🚴 Bike Sales Analysis – Internship Project (Excel Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository presents a **Bike Sales Analysis** project completed during my internship, where I designed and implemented an **interactive Excel dashboard** to analyze customer demographics and sales trends. The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw datasets into actionable insights using **Excel functions, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers**, while also applying data storytelling techniques to make findings accessible to both technical and non‑technical audiences.

The dashboard provides a multi‑dimensional view of bike purchases, enabling stakeholders to filter by age, income, region, commute distance, marital status, education, home ownership, and car ownership. This interactivity allows decision‑makers to explore customer behavior dynamically and identify growth opportunities.
