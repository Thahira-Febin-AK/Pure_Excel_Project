# Bike Sales Analysis – Internship Project (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Bike Sales Analysis** project completed during my internship. The goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics and sales trends for bike purchases using **Microsoft Excel**. By transforming raw data into meaningful insights, the project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced Excel techniques, build dashboards, and communicate findings in a professional, recruiter‑friendly format.

## 🎯 Business Objective & Problem Statement
- **Objective:** Identify key customer segments and behavioral patterns that drive bike purchases.  
- **Problem Statement:** Despite steady sales, the company lacked clarity on who the primary buyers were, what factors influenced their decisions, and where growth opportunities existed. This project addresses these questions and provides actionable recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- **Tool:** Microsoft Excel  
- **Why Excel?**
  - Widely accessible and recruiter‑friendly.  
  - PivotTables and PivotCharts for dynamic analysis.  
  - Slicers for interactive filtering across multiple dimensions.  
  - Easy export to professional formats (PDF, PowerPoint).  

- **Techniques Applied:**
  - Data cleaning and preparation (handling nulls, formatting).  
  - Advanced Excel functions (VLOOKUP, IF, conditional formatting).  
  - PivotTables & PivotCharts for multi‑dimensional analysis.  
  - Dashboard design for storytelling and visualization.  

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
### Age Group Analysis
- Adults (478 purchases) are the largest segment, followed by Young buyers (265).  
- Seniors contribute minimally (50).  
**Insight:** Adults and Young customers are the most promising target groups for marketing campaigns.  

### Income Level Impact
- Low Income (493) and Lower Middle Income (425) groups dominate bike purchases.  
- High Income buyers are very few (31).  
**Insight:** Affordability strongly influences bike purchases. Budget and mid‑range models should be prioritized.  

### Regional Sales
- Europe records the highest bike sales, particularly among lower‑middle income customers.  
- North America and Pacific regions show balanced but smaller contributions.  
**Insight:** Europe is the strongest market, while North America offers lifestyle‑driven opportunities.  

### Commute Distance
- Short commutes (0–1 miles) drive the majority of purchases.  
- Long commutes are dominated by Young buyers, but overall numbers are smaller.  
**Insight:** Bikes are primarily chosen for short‑distance convenience, positioning them as “last‑mile transport.”  

### Marital Status
- Purchases are fairly balanced: Married (549) vs. Single (477).  
- Married males and single females are strong segments.  
**Insight:** Both groups are important. Marketing can highlight family utility for married buyers and lifestyle/freedom for singles.  

## ✅ Conclusion & Business Recommendations
Bike purchases are driven by Adults and Young customers, primarily from low to middle income groups, with strong representation from educated professionals. Regional differences highlight affordability in Europe and lifestyle adoption in North America and the Pacific. Commute distance patterns show bikes are favored for short trips, and marital status analysis reveals balanced demand across both segments.  

**Recommendations:**
- **Target Marketing:** Focus campaigns on Adults and Young professionals with affordable models.  
- **Regional Strategy:** Promote budget bikes in Europe, lifestyle bikes in North America.  
- **Commute Positioning:** Market bikes as convenient short‑distance transport.  
- **Upsell Opportunities:** Highlight premium models to management professionals and multi‑car households.  
- **Education‑Driven Campaigns:** Position bikes as aspirational products for graduates and young professionals.
